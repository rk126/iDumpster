# This is a python module that handles the data structure for the system's components.
# Any new component are defined here by creating a class and a constructor for initializing itself.
# For e.g. A truck when defined as a component can be defined as
# class truck:
#  current_location = None
#  fuel = None
#  garbage = None
#  status = None
#  def __init__(location_tuple, fuel_level, garbage_level, status):
#
